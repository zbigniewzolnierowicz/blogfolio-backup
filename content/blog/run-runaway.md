# Run, runaway!

The duo is on the run from this gigantic conglomerate that controls the largest, most advanced city on the planet
I also decided to give the dude a codename - Code Talker (shortened to Talker)
When running away, he stumbles into the main character's friends' parents' restaurant and it goes like this:

- CT: "which one of you makes the deliveries?"
- Furion Plack, owner: "why would you need such information, partner?"
- CT: "just answer the question"
- FP: "this kid."
- CT: "alright. kid, get me to your resupply point on your next run."
- You: initial refusal
- CT: pulls out a wad of cash "how about now?"

You then can either accept and move on with the plot, or refuse and get a Paper Mario-like pre-emptive game over
Because the gangsters trying to catch Code Talker for the bounty found him at your restaurant and gunned down him, you, your friend, their parents, and a couple others.
If you accept, the dude just stumbles into your room and falls asleep in the corner.

Next day, you do your run, but then get jumped by a bunch of desert bandits, because they want your cash, like most bandits do.
They open the back of your delivery truck and notice CT in there, so they snap a picture of him and you, send it off to the company's bounty board, and now your face is everywhere in the city, on the communicators of gang syndicates and small time vandals trying to become rich and famous.
After that, they get shot by Code Talker with his two giant revolvers I called The Rotaries.

So now you gotta stay low, deal with bandits, kill people trying to kill you (and their higher-ups), do what Code Talker suggest you should do, earn money and win a race to visit the CEO of that company and punch his eyes out through his urethra.
I'm a bit fuzzy about the rest of the game, I just have the beginning down pat.
Also before he stumbles into the restaurant, you still have some battles and such, just to familiarize you with the controls.
The attack on the truck is a scripted fight you can't win
